*.pfx to *.pem: `openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -out cert.pem -nodes`

Split the *.pem for Apache:

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/public.crt             //Certificate
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/private.key         //Private Key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/crt/intermediate.crt  //Intermediate Certificate
