The ultimate website to check SPF and DKIM configuration: [dkimvalidator.com](http://dkimvalidator.com)

Simply send a test email to a random address @dkimvalidator, then check on the site to see if mail from your mail server will be considered as spam.

Tip: no need to resend after reconfiguring SPF or DKIM, simply let the site re-check the same mail, it will be reprocessed.
