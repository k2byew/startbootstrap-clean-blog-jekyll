Have your own domain name for your Blogger site? Domain ownership can be verified using DNS by setting a special CNAME.

If one day you lose your DNS record sets, how to find this special CNAME again?
It's can be found here: https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home

But actually, once verified, no need to re-verify!
Just put in Blogger's one CNAME plus four A-records and the site will work again.
